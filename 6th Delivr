The goal of this project is to build an interactive and computerized information system for our 
client "Chiltech" (a french drain cleaning industry). In order to this, the whole project has been separated into many sub
projects such as "gather basic client information", "create user stories", "design prototyes", etc.
For this specific sub-project, the main goal is to produce a second prototype from the information of the first prototype.
In this prototype, our team needs to improve it based on client's feedbacks and comments on the first(paper) prototype.
This second prototype should be done on computer, using drawing tools such as Photoshop or even use HTML/CSS. The idea
is to give the client an idead what the actually information system will look like (the UI). The prototype could contains
several screens and should be clearly demonstrated to the client the interaction between them.
