Our client "Chiltech" is a french drain cleaning industry. Chiltech’s services includes; 
Bacterial and Algae treatment, French drain cleaning, Drain examination for contamination, and Maintenance treatments.
They usually do some evalutations before the treatements. The evaluations procedures involves a collection of water samples
and camera inspection of the drainage pipes. After this procedure, the samples are sent to a laboratory for a final 
analysis so that they can determine the presence of bacteria contamination. Then they will report to the clients with 
pictures and recommendations for the cleaning services. Our client's computer skills are limited, they only know simple
tasks such as browsing web pages and creating some simple files and folders. The information system they are currently
using is the "paper method" which they record the client's inforamtion and payments on a cashier. Our client wants to have
an interactive information system so they can easily add, modify and delete their customers' records. They want the user interface
to be clean and straightforward but they want also a minimum security function such as a login name and password in order to
make all those changes.
