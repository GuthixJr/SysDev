To enlighten the reader on our client, we are providing our service to a French Drain cleaning company known as ChilTech. This company provides services such as;
Bacterial and Algae Treatment, French Drain cleaning, drain examination for contamination, and maintenance services. 
They follow many different practices and utilize their tools and knowledge available in order to go through with these services. 
Our client only knows basic computer knowledge, and currently owns a website made to advertise and draw in customers. 
Because of this, their current information system is stored on paper instead of an actual online database. 
The client wishes for us to create an interactive system in a way where he could easily add, modify, refer to, and delete any sort of records.
They requested for it to be straight forward and with the least amount of clutter possibly, as well as a basic login screen as their security access. 

As seen on page X, we have scanned the rough prototype of how every interface within the system may look like as drawn by our client, 
and later redrawn. It only consists of three separate interfaces, but it covers all of which our client requests. 
Our client added how he wanted feasibility as well as functionality, purposing it in a way where anyone without knowledge of 
using an information system can easily navigate and use, as well as ensuring the system is functioning properly. 

As for our user stories, please refer to pages X-X. These provide the basic requirements and tests that are required to be done 
in order to successfully provide those requested actions. As it can be seen, we have a few extra stories, 
mainly surrounding the way our prototype will work. Giving the ability to add future clients, modify them, and delete them if necessary.
As well as enter a given username and password.
Lastly, in order to refer to the mapping of these user stories, please refer to page X.

has been added since the last deliverable

Our client "Chiltech" is a french drain cleaning industry. Chiltech’s services includes; 
Bacterial and Algae treatment, French drain cleaning, Drain examination for contamination, and Maintenance treatments.
They usually do some evalutations before the treatements. The evaluations procedures involves a collection of water samples
and camera inspection of the drainage pipes. After this procedure, the samples are sent to a laboratory for a final 
analysis so that they can determine the presence of bacteria contamination. Then they will report to the clients with 
pictures and recommendations for the cleaning services. Our client's computer skills are limited, they only know simple
tasks such as browsing web pages and creating some simple files and folders. The information system they are currently
using is the "paper method" which they record the client's inforamtion and payments on a cashier. Our client wants to have
an interactive information system so they can easily add, modify and delete their customers' records. They want the user interface
to be clean and straightforward but they want also a minimum security function such as a login name and password in order to
make all those changes.

(Added: Descrption of the new information system that client wants.)
