Based on your understanding of the client’s requirements, you will produce a design of the database
system. In order to describe this design, referring to the initial class diagram (3rd deliverable), 
1 - you will produce an ER diagram and describe the relational table structure.
2 - You will also determine the physical characteristics of the database system. (You are free to use MS Access, Oracle, or any other implementation of SQL for this implementation.)
3 - You will explain the technical specifications for storing and retrieving data. 
The goal is to create a design for storing data that will provide adequate performance and insure database integrity, security and recoverability. It is at this point that you need to consider the size of the database, both now and for the future (three to five years).
4 - You also need to think about how quickly the database needs to be accessed.
5 - You will also show the user interface developed to access the database.
