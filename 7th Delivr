Based on your understanding of the client’s requirements, you will produce a design of the database
system. In order to describe this design, referring to the initial class diagram (3rd deliverable), 
1 - you will produce an ER diagram and describe the relational table structure.
2 - You will also determine the physical characteristics of the database system. (You are free to use MS Access, Oracle, or any other implementation of SQL for this implementation.)
3 - You will explain the technical specifications for storing and retrieving data. 
The goal is to create a design for storing data that will provide adequate performance and insure database integrity, security and recoverability. It is at this point that you need to consider the size of the database, both now and for the future (three to five years).
4 - You also need to think about how quickly the database needs to be accessed.
5 - You will also show the user interface developed to access the database.

  o (3 marks) Indexes and database architectures - Zheng 
  
  The database will have four tables at total: users, treatments, payments, customers. Users table contains user login
  information (username and password), only admin user can edit records in the database, other users can only view the database
  records. The user_id will be the primary key in the user table, username will be unique and username and password will be the "login" INDEX. Treatments 
  table contains treatment information such as treatment type and date. The primary key for treatment table will be treatment_id. 
  Payments table contains payment information such as payment type, date and amount. The primary key for payment table will be 
  payment_id. Customers table contains general customer information such as customer's first and last name, phone number, address and email. 
  The primary key for this table will be the customer_id, it also contains foregin keys (payment_id and treatment_id) that will
  reference the treatments and payments tables for this specific customer.
  
  o (3 marks) Query optimization - Zheng 
  
  For query optimization, we are using prepared statements because it's not only faster if executing statement several times but
  also it's a good way to prevent SQL injection. With prepared statements, we can bind direct variables to return
  columns which means not only data does not need to be converted back and forth but we also save extra data copying from 
  row structure to our variables. The strategy we are using on query optimization is basically to save on query parsing and
  to save on data conversion and copying, and also to avoid SQL injection.
